This file contains functions related to circuits.
This file works with jax.numpy to realize auto-differentiation.

The gate in this code has the convention (0,1,2,3) which corresponds to

   0      1

   2      3

  |0>    |0>


In terms of matrix vector notation, U(i',j', i, j) |state(i,j)>,
U can act on the state from the left as the usual way.

Note the difference in convention is the old qTEBD.py or
circuit_func.py file, where U is act from the right.

## Basically, if we do not use gpu or tpu and work with

    Goal:
        Do a sweep from top of the circuit down to product state,
        and do a sweep from bottom of the circuit to top.

        When sweeping from top to bottom, we take the target state (top) and
        circuit state (bottom), we remove one unitary at a time by
        applying the conjugate unitary.
        We then form the environment. Once a new unitary is obtained, it is
        applied to the "bra", i.e. top state.

        When sweeping from bottom to top, we take the product state, and the
        top state resulting from the first part of the algorithm.
        We remove one unitary at a time from the top state by applying the
        conjugate unitary. We then form the environment. Once a new unitary
        is obtained, it is applied to the bottom state.

        In this approach, we do not store the intermediate state representation.
        We avoid it by the removing unitary approach.
        There is no disadvantage of non exact cancellation of unitary as in
        MPS simulatino, since all the computation here is numerical exact.
